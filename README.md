- Unity adaptation of the project developed on .net framework has been facilitated by applying MVC design pattern.
- Algorithms have been developed that include calculating the point at which the chess pieces can move according to the situation they are in.
- Algorithms that control the game flow have been developed. (Progress, Finish and Forward-Backward)
- A simple bot was developed as a competitor. This bot randomly chooses one of the points it can go to and advances.
