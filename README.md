# Chess_Game
Some algorithm about chess.
I wanted to write my own chess game. The algorithms here belong to me. Also, I tried to implement the MVC structure to move the application to Unity.

# Application Content

  <li> Playing human vs human.</li>
  <li>Playing human vs bot. </li>

  <li>Move forward and backward </li>
  <li>Display by team selection.</li>
  <li>Game ending conditions. </li>
</ul>
